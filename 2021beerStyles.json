    "history": "Coors briefly made a light lager in the early 1940s.

Beers of this genre became the largest sellers in the United States in the 1990s.Evolved from Pre-Prohibition Lager (see Category 27) in the US after Prohibition and World War II. Surviving breweries consolidated, expanded distribution, and heavily promoted a beer style that appealed to a broad range of the population. Became the dominant beer style for many decades, and spawned many international rivals who would develop similarly bland products for the mass market supported by heavy advertising.A sparkling or present-use ale from the second half of the 1800s that survived prohibition. An ale brewed to compete with lagers brewed in Canada and the US Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest states.An American craft beer adaptation of the Weissbier style using a cleaner yeast and more hops, first produced by Anchor in 1984 and later widely popularized by Widmer.",

More popular in Southern Germany.Since 1990, the majority of beer served at Oktoberfest in Munich has been this style. Export beer specifically made for the United States is still mainly of the traditional amber style, as are US-produced interpretations. Paulaner first created the golden version in the mid-1970s because they thought the traditional Oktoberfest was too filling. So they developed a lighter, more drinkable but still malty version that they wanted to be “more poundable” (according to the head brewer at Paulaner). But the actual type of beer served at Oktoberfest is set by a Munich city committee.A fairly recent development in comparison to the other members of the bock family. The serving of Maibock is a seasonal offering associated with springtime and the month of May, and may include a wider color and hopping range than is seen in exported products.",

Light use of pale crystal type malts possible. Traditional German hops. Clean lager yeast. Decoction mash is traditional, but boiling is less than in Dunkles Bock to restrain color development.

Modern Weissbier dates from 1872 when Schneider began production of its amber version. However, pale Weissbier only became popular since the 1960s (although the name historically could be used in Germany to describe beer made from air-dried malt, a different tradition). It is quite popular today, particularly in southern Germany.Bavaria has a wheat beer brewing traditional hundreds of years old, but the brewing right was reserved for Bavarian royalty until the late 1700s. Old-fashioned Bavarian wheat beer was often dark, as were most beers of the time. Pale Weissbier started to become popular in the 1960s, but traditional dark wheat beer remained somewhat of an old person’s drink.Dopplebock-strength Aventinus was created in 1907 at the Schneider Weisse Brauhaus in Munich.

    "appearance": "Pale straw to gold in color. Very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head. Can be hazy and have a shine from wheat and yeast, although this can settle out in bottles.",
    "aroma": "Moderate to strong esters and phenols, typically banana and clove, often well balanced and typically stronger than the malt. Light to moderate bready, doughy, or grainy wheat aroma. Light vanilla optional. Light floral, spicy, or herbal hops optional. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.",
    "flavor": "Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor, often well balanced. Low to moderate soft, somewhat bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavor supported by the slight Pils malt grainy sweetness. Very low to moderately low bitterness. Well-rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. Light vanilla optional. Very low floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor optional. Any impression of sweetness is due more to low bitterness than any residual sweetness; a sweet or heavy finish impairs drinkability. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults. While the banana-and-clove profile is important, it should not be so strong as to be extreme and unbalanced.",

    "history": "While Bavaria has a wheat beer tradition dating back before the 1500s, brewing wheat beer used to be a monopoly reserved for Bavarian royalty. Modern Weissbier dates from 1872 when Schneider began production of its amber version. However, pale Weissbier only became popular since the 1960s (although the name historically could be used in Germany to describe beer made from air-dried malt, a different tradition). It is quite popular today, particularly in southern Germany.",

Ale in bottle was originally developed to compete with imported bottled pale ales from British breweries, such as Bass and Wm Younger’ Monk. By the early 20th century, bottled pale ale went out of fashion and “lighter” lager beers were in vogue. Many Australian Sparkling and Pale Ales were labeled as ales, but were actually bottom-fermented lagers with very similar grists to the ales that they replaced. Coopers of Adelaide, South Australia is the only surviving brewer producing the Sparkling Ale style.Originally a pale stock ale from London that was first shipped to India in the late 1700s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery did not create the style, but was the first well known brewer to dominate the market. After a trade dispute, the East India Company had Samuel Allsopp recreate (and reformulate) the beer in 1823 using Burton’s sulfate-rich water. The name India Pale Ale wasn’t used until around 1830.\nStrength and popularity declined over time, and the style virtually disappeared in the second half of the 20th century. While the stronger Burton-type IPA remained, the name was also applied to hoppy, lower-gravity, often bottled products (a trend that continues in some modern British examples). The style underwent a craft beer rediscovery in the 1980s, and is what is described in these guidelines.\nModern examples are inspired by classic versions, but shouldn’t be assumed to have an unbroken lineage with the exact same profile.

    "history": "Historically, ‘mild’ was simply an unaged beer, and could be used as an adjective to distinguish between aged or more highly hopped keeping beers. Modern milds trace their roots to the weaker X-type ales of the 1800s, which started to get darker in the 1880s, but only after WWI did they become dark brown. In current usage, the term implies a lower-strength beer with less hop bitterness than bitters. The guidelines describe the modern British version. The term ‘mild’ is currently somewhat out of favor with consumers, and many breweries no longer use it. Increasingly rare. There is no historic connection or relationship between Mild and Porter.Brown ale has a long history in Great Britain, although different products used that name at various times. Modern brown ale is a 20th century creation; it is not the same as historical products with the same name. A wide range of gravities were brewed, but modern brown ales are generally of the stronger (by current UK standards) interpretation. This style is based on the modern stronger British brown ales, not historical versions or the sweeter London Brown Ale described in the Historical Beer category. Predominantly but not exclusively a bottled product currently.Originating in London in the early 1700s, porter evolved as a more heavily hopped and aged (keeping) version of the Brown Beer popular at the time. It evolved many times based on various technological and ingredient developments (such as the invention of black malt in 1817, and large-scale industrial brewing), as well as consumer preferences, wars, and tax policy. It became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the early 1800s before declining by the 1870s as it changed to a lower gravity, unaged beer. As gravities continued to decline in all UK beers in the first half of the 1900s, styles stopped being made (including porter, gone by the 1950s). The craft beer era led to its re-introduction in 1978.\nThe name is said to have been derived from its popularity with the London working class performing various load-carrying tasks of the day. Parent of various regional interpretations over time, and a predecessor to all stouts (which were originally called “stout porters”).

    "history": "Originating in London in the early 1700s, porter evolved as a more heavily hopped and aged (keeping) version of the Brown Beer popular at the time. It evolved many times based on various technological and ingredient developments (such as the invention of black malt in 1817, and large-scale industrial brewing), as well as consumer preferences, wars, and tax policy. It became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the early 1800s before declining by the 1870s as it changed to a lower gravity, unaged beer. As gravities continued to decline in all UK beers in the first half of the 1900s, styles stopped being made (including porter, gone by the 1950s). The craft beer era led to its re-introduction in 1978.\nThe name is said to have been derived from its popularity with the London working class performing various load-carrying tasks of the day. Parent of various regional interpretations over time, and a predecessor to all stouts (which were originally called “stout porters”). There is no historic connection or relationship between Mild and Porter.",
    "characteristicIngredients": "Grists vary, but something producing a dark color is always involved. Chocolate or other roasted malts, caramel malt, brewing sugars, and the like are common. London-type porters often use brown malt as a characteristic flavor.",
    "styleComparisonAndVitalStatistics": "Differs from American Porter in that it usually has softer, sweeter, and more caramelly flavors, lower gravities, and usually less alcohol; American Porter also usually has more hop character. More substance and roast than a British Brown Ale. Higher in gravity than a Dark Mild.",

    "history": "An English style of stout developed in the early 1900s. Historically known as “Milk” or “Cream” stouts, legally this designation is no longer permitted in England but may be acceptable elsewhere. The “milk” name is derived from the use of the milk sugar lactose as a sweetener. Originally marketed as a tonic for invalids and nursing mothers.A variant of nourishing or invalid stouts around 1900 using oatmeal in the grist, similar to but independent of the development of sweet stout using lactose. An original Scottish version used a significant amount of oat malt. Later went through a shady phase where some English brewers would throw a handful of oats into their parti-gyled stouts in order to legally produce a ‘healthy’ Oatmeal Stout for marketing purposes. Most popular in England between the World Wars, was revived in the craft beer era for export, which helped lead to its adoption as a popular modern American craft beer style that uses a noticeable (not symbolic) quantity of oats.A local adaptation of Foreign Extra Stouts brewed with indigenous ingredients and methods in the Caribbean and other tropical markets. Bitterness lower than export-type stouts since these beers do not have to be shipped abroad, and to suit local palate preferences.Stronger stouts brewed for the export market today, but with a history stretching back to the 18th and 19th centuries when they were more heavily-hopped versions of stronger export stouts. Vatted originally, but Guinness stopped this practice in the 1950s. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (originally, West India Porter, later Foreign Extra Double Stout) was first brewed in 1801 according to Guinness with “extra hops to give it a distinctive taste and a longer shelf life in hot weather.”",

There are at least two definite types in Britain today, weaker, unaged draught ones that are similar to milds of around 4.5%, and stronger aged ones that are often 6-8% or more.Descended from Edinburgh Ales, a stronger malty beer brewed in a range of strengths, similar to Burton Ale (although at half the hopping rate). Modern versions have two main variants, a more modest 5% ABV beer and the more widely known 8-9% ABV beer.  As gravities decreased over times, some of the variations ceased to be produced.A modern descendent of the strongest Burton Ales. Bass No. 1 was first called a barley wine in 1872.

    "overallImpression": "An ale of respectable alcoholic strength, traditionally bottled-conditioned and cellared. Can have a wide range of interpretations, but most will have varying degrees of malty richness, late hops and bitterness, fruity esters, and alcohol warmth. The malt and adjunct flavors and intensity can vary widely, but any combination should result in an agreeable palate experience.",
    "appearance": "Amber to dark reddish-brown color; many are fairly dark. Generally clear, although darker versions may be almost opaque. Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored head with average retention.",
    "aroma": "Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried-fruit, caramel, nuts, toffee, or other specialty malt aromas. Some alcohol notes are acceptable, but shouldn’t be hot or solventy. Hop aromas can vary widely, but typically have earthy, resiny, fruity, or floral notes. The balance can vary widely, but most examples will have a blend of malt, fruit, hops, and alcohol in varying intensities.",
    "flavor": "Medium to high malt character often rich with nutty, toffee, or caramel flavors. Light chocolate notes are sometimes found in darker beers. May have interesting flavor complexity from brewing sugars. Balance is often malty, but may be well hopped, which affects the impression of maltiness. Moderate fruity esters are common, often with a dark fruit or dried fruit character. The finish may vary from medium dry to somewhat sweet. Alcoholic strength should be evident, not overwhelming. Low diacetyl optional, but generally not desirable.",
    "mouthfeel": "Medium to full, chewy body. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always welcome. Low to moderate carbonation. Smooth texture.",
    "history": "A collection of unrelated minor styles, each of which has its own heritage. Do not use this category grouping to infer a historical relationship between examples – none is intended. This is a modern British specialty judging category where the ‘special’ attribute is alcohol level.",
    "characteristicIngredients": "Grists vary, often based on pale malt with caramel and specialty malts. Some darker examples suggest a light use of dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt). Sugary and starchy adjuncts (e.g., maize, flaked barley, wheat) are common. Finishing hops are traditionally English.",
    "styleComparisonAndVitalStatistics": "Significant overlap in gravity with Old Ale, but not having an aged character. A wide range of interpretations is possible. Should not be as rich or strong as an English Barley Wine. Stronger than the stronger everyday Strong Bitter, British Brown Ale, and English Porter.

Modern versions are based on Anchor Brewing re-launching the style in the 1970s.Most commercial American Browns are not as aggressive as the original homebrewed versions, and some modern craft-brewed examples. This style reflects the current commercial offerings typically marketed as American Brown Ales rather than the hoppier, stronger homebrew versions from the early days of homebrewing.

Darker malts add a gentle and supportive flavor, not a strongly roasted or burnt character.Hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong like an American IPA, but with dark caramel, chocolate, toffee, or dark fruit character as in an American Brown Ale. Retaining the dryish finish and lean body that makes IPAs so drinkable, a Brown IPA is a little more flavorful and malty than an American IPA without being sweet or heavy.A very pale, hop-forward American IPA variant with a bone-dry finish, very high carbonation, and a restrained bitterness level. Can be suggestive of a sparkling white wine or Champagne. The hop character is modern, and emphasizes flavor and aroma dimensions.Hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong like an American IPA, but with some caramel, toffee, or fruit character as in an American Amber Ale. Retaining the dryish finish and lean body that makes IPAs so drinkable, a Red IPA is a little more flavorful and malty than an American IPA without being sweet or heavy.An American IPA with spicy, grainy rye malt. The rye gives a bready and peppery flavor, a creamier body, and a dry, grainy finish.A fruity, spicy, refreshing version of an American IPA, but with a lighter color, less body, and featuring the distinctive yeast or spice additions typical of a Witbier.An American IPA with intense fruit flavors and aromas, a soft body, smooth mouthfeel, and often opaque with substantial haze. Less perceived bitterness than traditional IPAs but always massively hop-forward.",

    "history": "The first modern American craft beer adaptation of this traditional English style is generally believed to be Anchor Liberty Ale, first brewed in 1975 and using whole Cascade hops; the style has evolved beyond that original beer, which now tastes more like an American Pale Ale in comparison. American-made IPAs from earlier eras were not unknown (particularly the well-regarded Ballantine’s IPA, an oak-aged beer using an old English recipe). This style is based on the modern craft beer examples.A relatively modern style, dating from the mid-2000s. Homebrewers and craft breweries substituted Belgian yeast in their American IPA recipes. Belgian breweries typically added more hops to their stronger pale beers.An American IPA variant first commercially produced by Greg Noonan as Blackwatch IPA around 1990. Popularized in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California of the US starting in the early-mid 2000s, and was a popular fad in the early 2010s before fading into obscurity in the US.See American Brown Ale.A modern craft beer style originating in 2017 at the (now closed) Social Kitchen & Brewery in San Francisco as a west coast reaction to the rising trend of east coast hazy and juicy IPAs as well as thick and sweet so-called milkshake IPAs. The style is still evolving and changing (and perhaps dying, as the beer was quite faddish in 2018-2019 in the US). Most versions seem to be morphing into low-calorie IPAs.A modern American craft beer style, based on American IPA but with the malt flavors of an American Amber Ale. See American Amber Ale.A modern craft era variation of American IPA, popular among homebrewers.American craft brewers developed the style as a late winter or spring seasonal beer to appeal to Witbier and IPA drinkers alike.A modern craft beer style originating in the New England region of the United States as an American IPA variant. Alchemist Heady Topper is believed to be the original inspiration as the style grew in popularity during the 2010s. The style continues to evolve, including a trend towards lower bitterness and using the style as the base for other additions.",
    "characteristicIngredients": "Pale base malt. American or English yeast with a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally all-malt, but sugar additions are acceptable. Restrained use of crystal malts. Often uses American or New World hops but any varieties are acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and may be used even if they do not have the sensory profiles listed as examples.Belgian yeast strains used in making Belgian Tripels and Golden Strong Ales. American examples tend to use American or New World hops while Belgian versions tend to use European hops and only pale malt. Sugar adjuncts common.Debittered roast malts. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and should not constrain this style to the example hop characteristics listed.Similar to an American IPA, but with medium or dark crystal malts, lightly roasted chocolate-type malts, or other intermediate color character malts. May use sugar adjuncts, including brown sugar. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable, but the hops and character malts should not clash.Pilsner or very pale base malts with up to 40% adjuncts. No crystal malt or lactose. Enzymes, such as amyloglucosidase. Highly aromatic, oil-heavy, modern American or New World hops used in a variety of late-hopping or post-boil procedures to emphasize hop aroma and flavor and to minimize bitterness. Neutral yeast.Similar to an American IPA, but with medium or dark crystal malts, possibly some character malts with a light toasty aspect. May use sugar adjuncts. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable, but the hops and character malts should not clash.Like an American IPA, with a generous portion of rye malt. Any American or New World hop is acceptable, but the hops and malt should not clash. No caraway. No oak.Pale and wheat malts, Belgian Witbier yeast, citrusy American type hops. Coriander and orange peel optional.Grist like an American IPA, but with more flaked grains and less caramel or specialty malts. American or New World hops with fruity characteristics. Neutral to estery yeast. Balanced to chloride-rich water. Heavily dry-hopped, partly during active fermentation, using a variety of hopping doses and temperatures to emphasis depth of hop aroma and flavor over bitterness. Biotransformation of hop oils during fermentation adds to the depth and fruit complexity.",
    "styleComparisonAndVitalStatistics": "Stronger and more highly hopped than American Pale Ale. Compared to English IPA, has less caramel, bread, and toast; often more American or New World hops; fewer yeast-derived esters; less body and often a more hoppy balance; and is slightly stronger than most examples. Less alcohol than a Double IPA, but with a similar balance.Currently Defined Types: Belgian IPA, Black IPA, Brown IPA, Red IPA, Rye IPA, White IPA, Brut IPAA cross between an American IPA or Double IPA with a Belgian Golden Strong Ale or Belgian Tripel. This style is may be spicier, stronger, drier, and fruitier than an American IPA.Balance and overall impression of an American or Double IPA with restrained roast similar to the type found in Schwarzbier. Not as rich and roasty as American Stout and Porter, and with less body and increased smoothness and drinkability.A stronger and more bitter version of an American Brown Ale, with the dry balance of an American IPA. Has less of a roasted flavor than Black IPA, but more chocolate flavors than a Red IPA.Less malt flavor, bitterness, and color than an American IPA, and much drier and more highly carbonated. Dry-hopped like an American IPA. Similar aroma and flavor as a Hazy IPA but without sweetness and with much less haze. Very pale, highly carbonated, and dry like a Belgian Golden Strong Ale but not as strong and without Belgian yeast character.A stronger, hoppier, more bitter version of American Amber Ale. Not as malty and sweet as an American Strong Ale. Drier, less alcohol, and not as malty as American Barleywine. Less chocolate and caramel than Brown IPA, but otherwise similar balance.Drier, slightly spicier, and slightly creamier than an American IPA, with more of a lingering bitterness and spiciness in the finish. Does not have the intense rye malt or Weizen yeast character of a Roggenbier.Bitter, hoppy, and stronger like an American IPA but fruity, spicy, and light like a Witbier. Typically late hops are not as prominent as in American IPA.Has a fuller, softer mouthfeel, a more fruit-forward late hop expression, a more restrained perceived bitterness balance, and a hazier appearance than American IPA. Many modern American IPAs are fruity and somewhat hazy; examples with a dry, crisp finish, at most medium body, and high perceived bitterness should be entered as 21A American IPA. Noticeable additions of fruit, lactose, vanilla, etc. to increase the fruity, smooth character should be entered in a specialty category defined by the additives (e.g., 29A Fruit Beer, 29C Specialty Fruit Beer, 30D Specialty Spice Beer).",

    "history": "An American craft beer innovation first developed in the mid-late 1990s as more intense version of American IPA.

Russian River Pliny the Elder, first brewed in 2000, helped popularize the style.While modern craft versions were developed as “imperial” strength versions of American amber or red ales, the style has much in common with historic American Stock Ales. Strong, malty beers were highly hopped to keep as provision beers prior to Prohibition. There is no continuous legacy of brewing stock ales in this manner, but the resemblance is considerable (albeit without the age character).Traditionally the strongest ale offered by a brewery, often associated with the winter season and vintage-dated. As with many American craft beer styles, an adaptation of an English style using American ingredients and balance. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said, “your Barleywine is too bitter” – to which Sierra Nevada replied, “thank you.”An American craft beer style that was first brewed at the Rubicon Brewing Company in 1988. Usually a winter seasonal, vintage, or one-off release.",

Many varieties of hops can be used, but typically includes American hops. American or English ale yeast.Typically brewed with a combination of American two-row and American wheat. Style commonly uses 50% or more wheat malt. Restrained use of dark malts. Any variety of hops may be used. May be oak-aged.",
    "styleComparisonAndVitalStatistics": "Bigger than English and American IPAs in alcohol strength, bitterness, and hoppiness. Less malty-rich, less body, drier, and with a greater overall hop balance than American Barleywine.Generally not as strong and as rich as an American Barleywine. More malt balanced than an American or Double IPA. More American hop intensity than a British Strong Ale. Maltier and fuller-bodied than a Red IPA.Greater emphasis on hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma than English Barley Wine, often featuring American hop varieties. Typically paler than the darker English Barley Wines and lacking their deeper malt flavors, but darker than the golden English Barley Wines. Differs from a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is fuller and often richer. American Barleywine typically has more residual sweetness than Double IPA, which affects the overall drinkability (sipping vs. drinking).More than simply a wheat-based Barleywine, many versions have very expressive fruity and hoppy notes, while others develop complexity through oak aging. Less emphasis on the hops than American Barleywine. Has roots in American Wheat Beer rather than any German wheat style, so should not have any Weizen yeast character.",

As with many American craft beer styles, an adaptation of an English style using American ingredients and balance. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said, “your Barleywine is too bitter” – to which Sierra Nevada replied, “thank you.”",

    "history": "A regional specialty of Berlin. Referred to by Napoleon’s troops in 1809 as “the Champagne of the North” due to its lively and elegant character. At one point, it was smoked and there used to be Märzen-strength (14 °P) version. Increasingly rare in Germany, but now produced in several other countries.An indigenous beer of West Flanders, typified by the products of the Rodenbach brewery, established in 1821. Aging in wooden vats and blending of old and young beers borrowed from the English tradition. Belgian brewers consider Flanders Red and Oud Bruin to be of the same style family, but the distinction was first made when Michael Jackson first defined beer styles, since the flavor profiles are distinctly different. Many modern examples are influenced by the popularity of Rodenbach Grand Cru.An indigenous beer of East Flanders, typified by the products of the Liefman brewery with roots back to the 1600s. Belgian brewers consider Flanders Red and Oud Bruin to be of the same style family, but the distinction was first made when Michael Jackson first defined beer styles, since the flavor profiles are distinctly different. Many modern examples are influenced by the popularity of Liefmans Goudenband. Unrelated to the dark, sweet Dutch lager of the same name.Spontaneously-fermented ‘wild’ ales from the area in and around Brussels (also known as the Senne Valley and the Pajottenland) stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old.Same basic history as Lambic, but involves blending, which may be performed outside the brewery. Some of the best examples are produced by blenders, who ferment, age, blend, and package the final product. Some modern producers are sweetening their products post-fermentation to make them more palatable to a wider audience. These guidelines describe the traditional dry product.Same basic history as Gueuze, including the recent sweetening trend but with fruit in addition to sugar. Fruit was traditionally added by the blender or publican to increase the variety of beers available in local cafés.Minor style associated with Leipzig but originating in the Middle Ages in the town of Goslar on the Gose River. Documented to have been in Leipzig by 1740. Leipzig was said to have 80 Gose houses in 1900. Production declined significantly after WWII, and ceased entirely in 1966. Modern production was revived in the 1980s in Germany, but the beer was not widely available. Became popular outside of Germany recently as a revival style, and is often used as a base style for fruited sour beers and other Specialty-Type beers.",
    "characteristicIngredients": ": Pilsner malt. Usually wheat malt, often at least half the grist. A symbiotic co-fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and LAB provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during fermentation and by cool aging. Decoction mashing with mash hopping is traditional. German brewing scientists believe that Brett is essential to get the correct, fruity-floral flavor profile.Vienna or Munich malts, a variety of caramel malts, maize. Low alpha acid continental hops. Sacch, Lacto, and Brett. Aged in oak. Sometimes blended and sweetened (natural or artificial).Pils malt, dark crystal malts, maize, small amounts of color malt. Low alpha acid continental hops. Sacch and Lacto. Aged. Water with carbonates and magnesium typical of its home region.Pilsner malt, unmalted wheat. Aged hops (3+ years) used more as a preservative than for bitterness. Spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in well-used, neutral oak barrels.Same as Lambic, except that one-, two-, and three-year old Lambics are blended, then cellared.Same base as Gueuze. Fruit added to barrels during fermentation and blending. Traditional fruit include tart cherries, raspberries; modern fruit include peaches, apricots, grapes, and others. May use natural or artificial sweeteners.Pilsner and wheat malt, restrained use of salt and coriander seed, Lacto. The coriander should have a fresh, citrusy (lemon or bitter orange), bright note, and not be vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like.

Compared to Straight Sour Beer and Catharina Sour, is lower gravity and may contain Brett.Less malty-rich than an Oud Bruin, often with more of a fruity-tart and acetic profile.A deeper malt character with more caramel, toffee, and chocolate flavors and darker color distinguishes these beers from Flanders Red Ale. The Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity flavors are more malt-oriented. In modern times, Oud Bruin also tends to be higher in alcohol than is typically seen in Flanders Red Ales.

Other examples date from post-World War II.Popularized by the monastery at Westmalle, first brewed in 1931.Westvleteren started making their version just before World War II, with Chimay and Rochefort adding their examples just after.

    "history": "Originally referred to lager beer matured in the caves or cellars under the brewery, and then served from them. First applied to amber lager from Franconia, then later to local Munich styles. More recently used internationally to create specialty Pils variants. By tradition, a serving style for a popular summer specialty in Bavaria, but now adapted broadly as a marketing term for unfiltered lagers.An American original, Kentucky Common was almost exclusively produced and sold around Louisville, Kentucky from some time after the Civil War until Prohibition. It was inexpensive and quickly produced, racked into barrels while actively fermenting, and tightly bunged to allow carbonation in the saloon cellar. Before the style died, it accounted for about 75% of sales around Louisville.\nSome have speculated it was a dark variant of Cream Ale, created by immigrant Germanic brewers who added darker grains to help acidity the local carbonate water.Originating in Lichtenhain, in Thüringen (central Germany). Height of popularity was towards the end of the 1800s, and was widely available throughout Thüringen. Like a pre-1840 Berliner Weisse.Developed by Mann’s as a bottled product in 1902. Claimed at the time to be “the sweetest beer in London.” Pre-WWI versions were around 5% ABV, but same general balance. Declined in popularity in second half of 20th century, and now nearly extinct.Developed as a unique style centuries ago in the Polish city of Grodzisk (known as Grätz when ruled by Prussia and Germany). Its fame and popularity rapidly extended to other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20th century. Regular commercial production declined after WWII and ceased in the 1990s. This style description describes the traditional version during its period of greatest popularity.An adaptation of continental lagers by immigrant German brewers in the mid-1800s in the US. Became most popular by the 1870s, but weakened in strength, bitterness, and popularity after Prohibition, and was largely replaced by Standard American Lager. Resurrected by homebrewers in the mid-1990s, but few commercial examples exist.Commercially brewed in Philadelphia during the revolutionary period as an adaptation of English beer. Evolved later as German immigrants applied lager brewing methods during the second half of the 1800s. Prohibition ended most porter brewing in the US, except in a few regional Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states where it was most popular.A specialty German rye beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria in 1988 by Schierlinger. After eventual purchase by Paulaner, the beer is now positioned as a regional brand and thus hard to find as an export.An indigenous traditional style from Finland; a farmhouse tradition for at least 500 years, often brewed for festive occasions like summer weddings, and consumed within a week or two of brewing.",
    "characteristicIngredients": "Same as base styles. Traditionally naturally carbonated. Dry-hopping is not a traditional German brewing method, but some modern pale examples use this technique – which is allowable in this style as long as it is balanced. Traditionally lagered and unfiltered, these beers were never meant to be packaged for external sale.Six-row barley malt. Corn grits. Caramel and black malt. Rustic American bittering hops. Imported Continental finishing hops. High carbonate water. Ale yeast.Smoked barley malt, wheat malt, Lacto, top-fermenting yeast. Grists vary, but the wheat would typically be 30-50%. Can be made with all barley malt.English pale ale malt as a base with a large proportion of darker caramel malts and often some black and wheat malts (this is Mann’s traditional grist – others can rely on dark sugars for color and flavor). Moderate to high carbonate water. English hops. Post-fermentation sweetening with lactose or artificial sweeteners, or sucrose, if pasteurized.Oak-smoked wheat malt, which has a less intense smoke character than German Rauchmalz, and a drier, crisper, leaner quality – a smoky bacon or ham flavor is inappropriate. Traditional Polish, Czech or German hops. Moderate hardness sulfate water. Clean, attenuative ale yeast; Weizen yeast inappropriate.Six-row barley. Corn or rice adjuncts, up to 30%. Traditional American or Continental hops. Modern American hops are inappropriate. Lager yeast.Two row or six row malt. Low percentages of dark malts including black, chocolate, and brown malt (roasted barley is not typically used). Adjuncts are acceptable, including corn, brewers licorice, molasses, and porterine. More historical versions will have up to twenty percent adjuncts. Lager or ale yeast. Historical or traditional American bittering hops, American or German finishing hops.Malted rye, up to 60% of the grist. Pale and wheat malts. Crystal-type malts and debittered dark malts can be used. Weizen yeast. German or Czech hops. Patented decoction type mash.Malted barley. Rye is common. Low hops, if any. Juniper boughs (with or without berries) used for lautering (traditionally in a hollowed-out log). Uses Finnish baker’s yeast in a fast, warm fermentation (German Weizen yeast is a reasonable substitute). Long step mash regime. Wort is not boiled.",

Not as acidic as Berliner Weisse, probably more like a smoked Gose without coriander and salt, or a Grodziskie with Gose-like acidity.May seem somewhat like a less roasty version of a Sweet Stout (and lower-gravity, at least for US sweet stout examples) or a sweet version of a Dark Mild.Similar in strength to a Berliner Weisse, but never sour and much more bitter. Has a smoked character but less intense than in a Rauchbier. Lower gravity than a Lichtenhainer, but more bitter and not sour. More bitter than a Gose, but no salt and spices.Similar balance and bitterness as modern Czech Premium Pale Lagers, but exhibiting native American grains and hops from the era before US Prohibition. More robust, bitter, and flavorful than modern pale American Lagers, often with higher alcohol.Smoother and less hoppy-bitter than a (modern) American Porter. Less caramelly and smoother than an English Porter with more of an adjunct or lager character. More bitterness and roast than an International Dark Lager.A more distinctive variant of a Dunkles Weissbier using malted rye instead of malted wheat.

    "name": "Grape Ale",
    "overallImpression": "Combines the profile of a sparkling wine and a relatively neutral base beer allowing the aromatic qualities of the grape to blend pleasantly with hop and yeast aromatics. Can be in a range from refreshing to complex.",
    "appearance": "Color can range from pale golden to ruby but those using red grapes tend towards burgundy. These darker colors may also come from using cooked or concentrated grape products, never from specialty dark grains. White to reddish head with generally a medium-low retention. Clarity is generally good. Never hazy.",
    "aroma": "Aromatic characteristics of the varietal grape are noticeable but should not dominate. The grape character should meld well with the underlying base malt character. While hop aroma is usually restrained, it can range from medium-low to entirely absent. Fermentation is usually quite clean but can have delicate spice and fruity esters. Banana, bubblegum, and the like are considered faults.",
    "flavor": "As with the aroma, grape character may range from subtle to medium-high intensity, and be most prominent. Fruit flavors (stone, tropical, berries, etc.) as appropriate for the variety of grape. Darker red grapes can contribute more rustic flavors (e.g., earthy, tobacco, leather). The malt character is supportive, not robust and usually of the pale, lightly kilned varieties. Very low levels of pale crystal malts are allowed but roasted or strong chocolate character is always inappropriate. Bitterness is generally low and hop flavors can be low to non-existent. Mild tart notes, due to variety and amount of grape used, is common and may help to improve the digestibility but should not near ‘sour’ threshold. Complementary oak is optional but a funky Brett character should not be present. Clean fermentation.",
    "mouthfeel": "Medium-high to high carbonation improves the perception of aroma. Body is generally from low to medium and some acidity can contribute to increased perception of dryness. Finish is exceedingly dry and crisp. Strong examples may show some warming.",
    "history": "Initially brewed at Birrificio Montegioco and Birrificio Barley in 2006-2007. Became more popular after being published in the 2015 Guidelines as Italian Grape Ale (IGA), and inspired many local variations in other countries.",
    "characteristicIngredients": "Pils or pale base malt, limited pale crystal or wheat malts. Grape must (red or white varieties, typically fresh must) is usually 15 – 20% of the total grist, but can exceed 40%. The must is fermented with the beer, not a blending of wine and beer. Fruity-spicy yeast are most common but neutral varieties can be used. Hops should be selected to complement the overall profile. This beer is not dry-hopped. Oak is allowable, but not required, and it should not be overpowering, or at levels stronger than found in wine.",
    "styleComparisonAndVitalStatistics": "Similar base as several Belgian styles, like Belgian Blonde, Saison, and Belgian Single, but with grapes. Higher strength examples are similar to Belgian Tripel or Belgian Golden Strong Ale, but with grapes. Not funky like Fruit Lambic.",
